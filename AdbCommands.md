https://gist.github.com/mrk-han/4bb41702f317c2534055d30acaa4ff9b


## ADB Devices
```bash
adb usb
adb root                          # Restarts adbd with root permissions
adb devices                       # List of connected devices
adb devices -l                    # List of connected devices by product/model
adb connect <IP>:<PORT>           # Connect to an remote adb device via ipaddress (Note: By default port is 5555)
adb -s <deviceName> <command>     # Redirect command to specific device (Ex: adb -s 127.0.0.1:5555 shell)
adb –d <command>                  # Directs command to only attached USB device
adb wait-for-device
```

## ADB Server
```bash
adb tcpip 5555                    # Start adb server on port 5555
adb kill-server
adb start-server
```

## Port Tunneling
In case the adb port is only accessible from localhost in the android device but you have access via SSH, you can forward the port 5555 and connect via adb:
```bash
ssh -i ssh_key username@10.10.10.10 -L 5555:127.0.0.1:5555 -p 2222
adb connect 127.0.0.1:5555
```

## ADB Shell
```bash
adb shell    # Open or run commands in a terminal on the host Android device.
```

## ADB Reboot Device
```bash
adb reboot
adb reboot -p
adb shell reboot -p
adb reboot recovery
adb reboot bootloader
adb reboot-bootloader
```

## LogCat
```bash
adb logcat [options] [filter] [filter]     # View device log
adb logcat -c                     # clear The parameter -c will clear the current logs on the device.
adb logcat -d > [path_to_file]    # Save the logcat output to a file on the local system.
adb bugreport > [path_to_file]    # Will dump the whole device information like dumpstate, dumpsys, and logcat output.
```

## Permissions
```bash
adb shell permissions groups                           # List permission groups definitions
adb shell list permissions -g -r                       # List permissions details
adb shell pm grant [package_name] [Permission]         # Grant a permission to an app. 
adb shell pm revoke [package_name] [Permission]        # Revoke a permission from an app.
adb shell pm reset-permissions -p app.package.name
```

## Files
```bash
adb push [source] [destination]    # Copy files from your computer to your phone.
adb pull [device file location] [local file location]    # Copy files from your phone to your computer.

adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf 1 | xargs -IX adb -s X install -r apk_file_path.apk  # Install the given app on all connected devices.
```

## Uninstalling App from Device
```bash
adb uninstall app.package.name              # Uninstall app
adb uninstall -k app.package.name           # Uninstall app without deleting data
adb shell pm clear app.package.name         # Deletes all data associated with a package.
adb shell pm uninstall app.package.name
```

## Update App
```bash
adb install -r apk_file_path.apk    # -r means re-install the app and keep its data on the device.
adb install –k apk_file_path_on_computer
```
